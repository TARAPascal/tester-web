# What is _Tester Web_?

_Tester Web_ is an HTTP web server to hold competitive programming contests. _Tester Web_ is based on [_Tester_](https://github.com/alex65536/tester) testing backend. It is suitable to hold local contests for small amount of participants.

# Advantages and disadvantages of _Tester Web_

The main advantages are:

* _Tester Web_ is very easy to install.
* Simplicity in use (no many options, it's easy to add a problem or a contest to it).
* Problems and contests can be accessed by many users. You can also choose access rights for each user.
* It will work on any machine under _Windows_ and _GNU/Linux_.
* The dependency list is very small: the compilers (`fpc`, `gcc`, `g++`) must be installed. There are no other dependencies.

The disadvantages are:

* _Tester Web_ is not designed to hold big contests with hundreds of participants and doesn't support distributed testing on many machines.
* No HTTPS support.
* Sometimes _Tester Web_ may be slow (will be optimized in the next versions).
* Currenty there is no sandboxing. _GNU/Linux_ users may try to use the patch for _Linux_ kernel from Ejudge authors [(info)](https://ejudge.ru/wiki/index.php/%D0%9F%D0%B0%D1%82%D1%87_%D0%BA_%D1%8F%D0%B4%D1%80%D1%83_Linux), which can be downloaded at [ejudge.ru](https://ejudge.ru/). This patch should work because _Tester Web_ uses _[Ejudge](https://ejudge.ru/)_ libraries for testing, but I haven't tested this patch yet.  
  **UPD:** If you will build _Tester Web_ yourself and use latest _timerlib_, the Ejudge patch will work, otherwise there will be no sandboxing. Note that is still _GNU/Linux_ only.

# Pre-requisites

## Common

* At first, you will need a computer ðŸ˜ƒ

* 1 GB RAM (recommended 2 GB or more)

* [_Free Pascal Compiler_](https://freepascal.org/) (for Pascal) and [_GNU GCC Compiler_](https://gcc.gnu.org) (for C/C++) installed. For _Windows_, paths to the compiler binaries must be set in `PATH` environment variable. _Tester web_ **will not launch** without the compliers.

## Windows

* Recommended _Windows_ versions are 7, 8, 8.1 or 10 (64-bit).

## GNU/Linux

* Tested on _Ubuntu 16.04, 17.10_ (64-bit), _Debian 9, 10_ (64-bit), but should work on other popular _GNU/Linux_ distros.

* Some checkers for problems may come only in EXE file, so you should install [_Wine_](https://winehq.org) to launch them.

# Downloading latest release

Latest release of _Tester Web_ can be found [here](https://github.com/alex65536/tester-web/releases/latest).

# Building from sources

## Building pre-requisites

### Common

* To build _tester_ from sources, you will need [_Lazarus IDE_](https://www.lazarus-ide.org) (recommended version is 1.6.4) with [_Free Pascal Compiler_](https://freepascal.org/) (recommended version is 3.0.2) and [_GNU GCC Compiler_](https://gcc.gnu.org). Also install _WebLaz_ package into your [_Lazarus IDE_](https://www.lazarus-ide.org).

### Windows

* Use the environment variable `PATH` to specify paths to [_Lazarus IDE_](https://www.lazarus-ide.org) directory and to [_GNU GCC_](https://gcc.gnu.org)'s `bin` directory.

* You will need [_Git Bash_](https://git-for-windows.github.io/).

### Linux

* You will need [_Git_](https://git-scm.com/).

* Also you can build inside [_Docker_](https://docker.io) and build a docker image with _Tester Web_. It is optional; building without _Docker_ is also supported.

## Building

To build _Tester Web_ from sources, follow these steps:

~~~~
$ git clone https://github.com/alex65536/tester-web
$ cd tester-web
$ git submodule init
$ git submodule update
$ cd build
$ ./build_all.sh
~~~~

This will build the archive with _Tester Web_ distribution. The archive will be located in `<repo dir>/package.zip`.

### Alternative build inside Docker

You can also use _Docker_ to build _Tester Web_. Here are the steps:

~~~~
$ git clone https://github.com/alex65536/tester-web
$ cd tester-web
$ git submodule init
$ git submodule update
$ cd build
$ ./build_with_docker.sh
~~~~

After the build succeeds, you will have `package.zip`, just like in the previous step.

### Building Docker image

When you get `package.zip` after building _Tester Web_, you can also build a _Docker_ image with it. To do this, use `build/build_docker_image.sh`.

# Installing

Installing _Tester Web_ is quite simple:

1. Get the _Tester Web_ distribution archive (download or build it) and unpack it anywhere you want.

2. Run the server program located in `<unpacked archive>/bin/tsweb` (the ending of the filename depends on the platform you are using). The working dir must be **the same as the directory where the server binary is located!**

3. Now log in as the server owner. Find the username and password in the configuration file stored in `<home dir>/tsweb/data/config.ini`. The keys `defaults.password` and `defaults.userName` in section `[owner]` of the config file store the default username and password. **It's recommended to change the password after your first login.**

4. Now the server it set. Congratulations! ðŸ˜ƒ

## Alternative way: using Docker

You can also use _Tester Web_ inside a _Docker_ container. There are no prebuilt images, you should build it yourself (see above).

Alternatively, you can use a _Docker_ image by [Ivan Udovin](https://github.com/udovin) ([link](https://hub.docker.com/r/wilcot/alex-tsweb/)). This image is also smaller.

# Usage

Coming soon ...

# Thanks to

[Ivan Udovin](https://github.com/udovin) for providing the scripts to build a _Docker_ image and to build inside _Docker_.

# Libraries used by _Tester Web_

* `fcl-web` which comes with [_Free Pascal Compiler_](https://freepascal.org/), that impements HTTP protocol.

* Some other libraries (can be found in `<repo dir>/third-party`):

	* Hashing library for Pascal, can be found at [http://www.wolfgang-ehrhardt.de/crchash_en.html](http://www.wolfgang-ehrhardt.de/crchash_en.html).

	* [_SyntaxHighlighter_](https://github.com/syntaxhighlighter/syntaxhighlighter), to view sources of submissions.

* [_Tester_](https://github.com/alex65536/tester) also uses some _exec.h_, _exec.c_ and some other source files from [_Ejudge_](https://ejudge.ru/). These files are made up into [_timerlib_](https://github.com/alex65536/tester/tree/master/timerlib).
